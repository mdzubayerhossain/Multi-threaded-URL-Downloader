# Multi-threaded URL Downloader

A high-performance multi-threaded URL downloader written in C using **libcurl** and **pthreads**. This program allows you to download multiple files concurrently, increasing efficiency and speed.

## Features
‚úÖ Multi-threaded downloads (up to 5 files simultaneously)  
‚úÖ Uses **libcurl** for efficient file transfers  
‚úÖ Supports large files with robust error handling  
‚úÖ Lightweight and optimized for performance  
‚úÖ Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows  

## Installation

### 1. Install libcurl (if not already installed)
#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```sh
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
#### macOS (Homebrew)
```sh
brew install curl
```
#### Windows (MinGW)
Download and install libcurl from [cURL official website](https://curl.se/download.html). Ensure it's properly linked during compilation.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mdzubayerhossain/Multi-threaded-URL-Downloader.git
cd multi-threaded-url-downloader
```

### 3. Compile the Program
```sh
gcc -o downloader downloader.c -lcurl -lpthread
```

### 4. Run the Program
```sh
./downloader
```

## Usage
By default, the program downloads 5 sample files from the internet. To modify the URLs and filenames, update the `DownloadTask` array in `downloader.c`.
